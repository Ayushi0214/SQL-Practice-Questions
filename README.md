# SQL-Practice-Questions
Welcome to the SQL Practice Repository 🎉

This repo is designed to solve a very common problem faced by students and professionals learning SQL:
👉 On platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode, it’s difficult to find topic-specific questions.
👉 Practical, business-use case problems are often missing.

This repository is built to give you structured, topic-wise practice on a real dataset with questions that are both interview-oriented and practical for analytics projects.
